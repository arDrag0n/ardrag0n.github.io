			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				A dragon is a reptile-like legendary creature that appears in the
				folklore of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary
				considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the
				High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned,
				four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures
				are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with
				above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are
				often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features. Scholars
				believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest
				resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas,
				and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

			<h2>Entamology</h2>
			<p>
				The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century
				from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin: draconem
				(nominative draco) meaning "huge serpent, dragon", from Ancient Greek
				δράκων, drákōn (genitive δράκοντος, drákontos) "serpent, giant
				seafish".[4][5] The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent,
				not necessarily mythological.[6] The Greek word δράκων is most likely
				derived from the Greek verb δέρκομαι (dérkomai) meaning "I see", the
				aorist form of which is ἔδρακον (édrakon).[5] This is thought to have
				referred to something with a "deadly glance,"[7] or unusually bright[8]
				or "sharp"[9][10] eyes, or because a snake's eyes appear to be always
				open; each eye actually sees through a big transparent scale in its
				eyelids, which are permanently shut. The Greek word probably derives
				from an Indo-European base *derḱ- meaning "to see"; the Sanskrit root
				दृश् (dr̥ś-) also means "to see".[11]
